<p>The following hints were originally designed
for the benefit of a few individuals,
for whom the author had a particular regard,
and also felt himself under obligations
to give them all that instruction which might
be deemed necessary to guide them in the
paths of virtue and morality, and to shun
those vices which often ruin the female sex,
and are too predominant in the world.</p>

<p>But as all young people are in one predicament,
and instructions that are suitable
for one, may be equally applied to the
whole; therefore, for the benefit of the
present, and future rising generations, these
few lines are made public.</p>

<p>And although the Author would not blush
to own this piece of work, yet, for certain
reasons, his name is concealed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="YOUNG"><small>TO</small><br>
YOUNG FEMALES, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>


<p>The most critical time of youth,
especially of the female sex, is while
they are in their juvenile years. At
this age, when they are entering as
it were upon the borders of life, to
act in some degree for themselves,
the greatest care and attention ought
to be paid to them. And from the
age of puberty, until they arrive to
maturity, and are settled in the
world, they ever ought to be considered
as under the care and protecting
eye of their parents, guardians,
or masters.</p>

<p>How can parents, guardians, or
masters, feel as though they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
discharged their duty towards their
children, and those under their care,
in this respect, when they see them,
entering on the wheels of time, exposed
to all the temptations of an
alluring world, and scarcely or never
give them one check or caution!</p>

<p>And as it is to be feared that some
parents, &amp;c. are guilty of too much
neglect on this hand, so others govern
with too much restraint on the
other. If you mean that your children
should learn to govern themselves,
you must learn it to them by
experience; that is, by giving them
a little lenity, together with your
good counsel and advice, and according
to their improvement, give them
more and more, until they learn the
art of self-government. But if you
endeavor to keep them wholly under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
restraint, and never let them learn
from experience the different manners
and customs of people abroad; if
they should happen to break out of
your reach (as most likely they will,
at certain times) they will (according
to the vulgar expression) behave
more like <em>hogs let out of the sty</em>; than
like ladies; and not knowing the
art of self government, they will be
likely to break over all rules of decency
and decorum.</p>

<p>But although parents, &amp;c. may
pay the strictest attention to their
children, &amp;c. unless there is the
greatest degree of caution and circumspection
attended to, on the part
of the children, it will avail but very
little.</p>

<p>Young people are apt to be insensible
to the danger they are in,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
until their name is stained with a
blot that is very hard to wipe away.
The wise man has justly observed,
that “A good name is rather to be
chosen than great riches, and loving
favor rather than silver and gold.”</p>

<p>The reputation of youth, a young
maiden more especially, may be compared
to china ware, or transparent
glass, which is very easily broken,
but impossible to mend, so but what
it will leave a blemish behind.</p>

<p>How often does the thoughtless
youth, in some unguarded hour,
fall into some trifling folly or other
which stamps a blur upon their characters,
and fills their minds with
shame and remorse. And it is too
frequently the case, that in order to
prevent the evils of one piece of
bad conduct, they run into another,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
which only sinks them deeper and
deeper. They then begin to give
up all hopes of recovery, their minds
become dissipated, and they give
themselves over to all the vain delusions
and allurements of time and
sense. And as they travel on in the
paths of folly, they become lost to
all sense of virtue and morality,
consequently happiness is fled, and
they generally become slaves to misery
and discontentment.</p>

<p>Such a life as this would be thought
scarcely worth possessing! yet how
often do we behold those who appeared
to be very promising when
they first started in life, and presented
to us the most pleasing prospects,
land on these shores at last, and
drag out a miserable life, with shame
and ignominy: while on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
hand, it often happens, that those
who make a small appearance, and
are thought but a very little of,
when they first set out in life; yet
by attending to good instruction, and
the strictest caution and prudence,
they have arisen to honor and dignity
in the world, and are loved and
esteemed by all virtuous people.</p>

<p>If these are facts, they show the
importance of early attending to instruction.</p>

<p>And that you, my young friend,
blooming with virgin beauty, unsullied
with vice, and unimpaired with
age; that you may shun those pernicious
practices that will lead you
in shame and disgrace, and pursue
those paths that will lead you to honor
and dignity in the world, and
gain you a name that is more valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
than silver or gold, I leave you
the following</p>


<h3>RULES.</h3>

<p>1. Keep a due regard over all
your thoughts, and see that they are
intent upon the business in which
you are employed, that you may pay
a proper attention to the same.</p>

<p>Nothing is more dangerous than
an absent mind. It is rude to indulge
the thoughts to rove upon indifferent
objects, even when you are
in company; but more especially
when attending to your domestic
concerns. If your thoughts are not
mostly engaged in the business before
you, time will steal away faster
than you are aware of; night will
come on before you are ready for it,
many things must go undone that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
you ought to have attended to, and
that which you have done will be
apt to be slighted, or done to the
halves; and you will thereby get to
yourself rebukes and reproaches,
which you might have easily prevented,
and you will now begin to
repent when it is too late to mend
a bad day’s work.</p>

<p>By indulging an absent mind,
young people are apt to be deaf to
all that is said to them, or at least, it
does not make an abiding impression
on their minds; by which means
they are apt to do their work wrong,
have it to undo, and do over again,
and sometimes spoil it in the end;
which will make them feel very
much chagrined, and also it will fret,
perplex, and weary the patience of
those who employ them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>All this might have been easily avoided
by care and attention; and
not only so, but you would improve
in your business, and thereby make
it become habitual and easy.</p>

<p>You cannot expect to become
master of any kind of business, without
much care and attention; and
this ought to make you more studious
in the same, for remember, that
there is no business that you will be
likely to be called to attend to, now
when young, but what (if you should
ever have a family of your own) you
must attend to the same for yourself,
or at least, have it attended to;
and therefore it is highly necessary
that you should now become master
of it.</p>

<p>This is what ought to excite
your mind now when young, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
you may be well qualified to be mistress
of your own family; and even
if you should never have any family,
this will do you no harm.</p>

<p>2. Never flatter yourself that
you know how the business should
be done better than your teachers;
therefore hear with patience their
instructions, and always be submissive
to their directions.</p>

<p>Never contradict them in any sense
whatever; but if you think that any
other way, different from what they
direct, would do better, you may inform
them of it, but do it with the
greatest modesty and circumspection;
and if they comply with what
you say, it is well, but if they do not,
add no more, but obey as you were
first directed.</p>

<p>Always make the business of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
day the first object, and then if you
have any leisure hours, you may
improve them to the best advantage
and for your own profit and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Never allow yourself to be peevish
and fretful about your work,
food, dress, or any thing of the like
nature, even if the business does
not go on to suit you; for this will
only make the business more irksome
and fatiguing, without any
kind of benefit to yourself.</p>

<p>3. Do not expect even from your
best endeavors wholly to escape
without censure. For the mind of
youth is so fickle, it would be very
strange if you did not sometimes go
astray, and not do so well as you
might; and if you do, you must expect
reproof, and rebuke, and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
ought to take it kindly, and endeavour
to do better for the future.</p>

<p>But even if you should always do
your best, you must expect that you
will sometimes do wrong, even for
want of knowledge; and you cannot
expect that people will always
exercise that patience, so but what
they will many times chide you,
and find fault, even when you have
done your best. All this you ought
to bear with patience without a murmuring
word: for if you are conscious
to yourself that you have
done as well as you could, even a
sharp rebuke need not trouble you;
for you may gain some knowledge by
it, and therefore it may terminate for
your own advantage. Besides, if
you bear it with patience, and try to
convince them by your future conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
that you used your best endeavors
to have every thing done
as it should be, this will have a tendency
to convince them of their error,
and cause them to exercise
more patience for the future.</p>

<p>Always pay a proper respect
to your parents, guardians, or masters,
and ever be submissive to their
commands. Never try to aggravate
them, even if they should find
fault at trifles; that is, to treat the
matter with a kind of indifferency,
though you did not care to displease
them; for this will only make
them more fretful for the future.—
But if you are sensible that you
have done wrong, you ought to confess
it, and endeavour to reform;
but if you think you are not to blame
let the whole matter pass in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>4. You must not only pay the
greatest attention to your domestic
concerns, but a proper decorum in
all your words and actions must be
attended to. Your leisure hours
should be employed in reading useful
books, which will be most likely
to furnish your mind with a store
of religious and moral improvements.
Read the characters of those ladies
who have lived virtuous and pious
lives, and endeavour to imitate their
examples.</p>

<p>And if you should ever happen
to read the characters of any profligate
women (not to call them ladies)
endeavour to make only this use of
their characters; that is, to shun
their vices, avoid their pernicious
practices, and thereby escape the
miseries that attend them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>5. Endeavour to treat all persons
with civility. Pay a proper respect
to your superiors, complaisance to
your equals and courteously treat
those whom you shall deem to be
your inferiors.</p>

<p>Establish in your own mind a certain
rule of decency and modesty,
to be attended to in all companies,
and at all times, whether at home or
abroad.</p>

<p>In all companies, give each one
an opportunity for their proper
share of conversation. Remember
that a talkative, loquacious woman,
a young woman more especially,
often exposes her weakness,
and sickens the ear with her babblings.
“The torrent of her words
overwhelmeth conversation.” Therefore
every species of rudeness ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to be avoided as unbecoming your
sex. Again, frequent and loud
laughter doth not become any person,
especially a woman, and a
young woman more especially.—
Therefore it ought to be avoided
on all occasions as not belonging to
the rules of decency, and as unbecoming
the fair sex.</p>

<p>6. The strictest attention must
be paid to the conversation which
you may occasionally have with the
other sex. Be not forward in beginning
a conversation with them;
but be always ready to return all
compliments that may be given to
you with an easy address, and in
a becoming manner, without being
daunted or even put to the blush.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate this business,
endeavour to treasure up in your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
memory, those addresses and compliments,
that by constant observation,
you may hear drop from those
whom you deem to be your superiors;
and endeavor to make them
familiar to yourself, so that you may
be able to use them on any occasion,
with propriety, &amp; without the appearance
of affectation or dissimulation.</p>

<p>And as you would avoid a prudish
disposition on the one hand, so
you must equally avoid a volatile,
idle, and wanton disposition on the
other. To facilitate which, give
yourself more to thinking and less
to talking, so that when you do
speak, you may always speak with
decency, modesty, and propriety.
Always mind to speak plain
and distinctly, and loud enough to
be understood, with a modest smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
on your face, without a rude look in
your countenance.</p>

<p>But let your speeches be short and
comprehensive; and never try to
prolong a conversation, unless it be
upon topics that are becoming your
sex. But if the conversation should
be disagreeable and unbecoming,
endeavor to turn the attention to
some other object, introduce some
other topic, or else find an occasion
of absence.</p>

<p>7. Remember that the bloom of
your youth, your healthy and ruddy
countenances, the rose on your
cheeks, and the sparkling vigor of
your eyes, will gain you more admirers
than real lovers. Here pause
for a few moments and consider!
for it is the most delicate point for
you to steer through and your name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and reputation to remain unsullied.</p>

<p>How often doth the blooming and
most promising youth, by one fatal
misstep, stain their characters with
ignominy, and blast their reputation
forever.</p>

<p>It is much easier to avoid temptation,
than to resist the deceitful arts
of the tempter.</p>

<p>The deceitful heart of a fond
admirer, out of a vain pretence
of love and affection, will work upon
every passion that wit can invent or
lust suggest, in order to allure your
affections, intrude upon your chastity,
and win you over to their fond
embraces, and carnal appetites.</p>

<p>O heed not their flatteries, neither
give way to their alluring and licentious
persuasions! for when they
have ruined you, their flatteries will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
be turned into contempt, and their
pretended love into downright hatred.
And in the end, they will even
forsake you, without regard or pity.
Therefore beware of sycophants!
and be not deceived by their enticing
words! Even if they reproach
you to your face for your rigorous
treatment, yet behind your back,
they will applaud your constancy.</p>

<p>Remember that the taste may be
satiated with the sweetest fruit,
where there is a full enjoyment;
but let a person participate only by
anticipation, and the nearer to enjoyment,
the more valuable the prize
will be.</p>

<p>8. Learn to distinguish between
true, genuine love, and mere fancy.
He who truly loves or respects you,
will not wish to have you violate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
your honor or chastity, neither will
he violently intrude upon the same,
although he may endeavour to prove
your constancy.</p>

<p>Therefore when you have reason
to believe that any one sincerely respects
you, and if you also wish to
continue to be worthy of his esteem;
remember that you cannot do any
thing more against yourself than to
give over your chastity, or go beyond
rules of decency.</p>

<p>But if you have reason to believe
that any one’s pretended love is
nothing more than mere fancy, which
will generally shew itself by a vehement
fondness; vows, promises, &amp;c.
learn to treat it with a silent neglect;
for his utmost wishes will never
promote your real happiness.</p>

<p>9. Be not anxious to be admired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
by every one, but only be careful
that the virtuous have no occasion
to speak evil against you; to avoid
which you have only to live a virtuous
life.</p>

<p>Keep a due regard over all your
words and actions; not only when
you are with those whom you esteem
to be virtuous, but even if you
should happen to fall in company
with those of the baser sort.</p>

<p>It hath been an old maxim, <em>that
when we are with the Romans, we
must do as the Romans do</em>. And the
maxim may be a good one, so far as
we can comply with it, and not break
over the rules of decency and propriety;
but no farther. For it is no
rule, neither will it be any excuse for
you, to be loose, vain, or lascivious,
even if you should happen to fall in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
company with persons of this description.
But the wiser method is,
to avoid all such company; for the
characters of persons are often judged
by the company they keep. Therefore,
if you would wish to avoid the reproaches
of every one, you must not
only abstain from vice yourself, but
you must forsake the company of
the vicious.</p>

<p>10. Do not reveal your secrets to
any one, unless it will be as much for
their interest to keep, as it will be for
yours to have them kept; and never
reveal the secrets of others, when it
will not injure you to keep them.</p>

<p>Never make any promise that
you do not mean to perform; and
fulfil all your promises when you
have once made them; unless you
find that you were deceived when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
you made them, and therefore ought
not to have promised.</p>

<p>Never speak of the failings of another
to a third person, but with the
greatest reluctance, especially those
of your own sex. If you can say no
good of persons, you had better say
nothing about them. For as you would
not wish to have your own failings
published to the world, so you must
be exceeding careful not to publish
the failings of others.</p>

<p>But should you discover a failing
in your friend, you may, and ought
to remind him or her of it, between
you and them alone, but do it with
the greatest modesty. And if your
friends should tell you of a fault,
take it kindly of them and endeavor
to reform.</p>

<p>Never appear to slight the company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of any one, while in their presence,
even if it should be disagreeable;
but rather endeavor to find some
just occasion of absence, and avoid
their company for the future.</p>

<p>Treat every one with civility, but
use no flattery nor dissimulation to
any one; but let the words of your
mouth be the sentiments of your heart.</p>

<p>11. Do not try to outvie all others
in dress, &amp;c. but let your dress
be modest, and suited to your circumstances.
Remember that a real character
doth not consist in the outward
adornings of the body, but in the
inward adornings of the mind and
understanding.</p>

<p>Although a fop, or a coxcomb,
might be charmed at the sight of
fine ribbons, and embroidered apparel;
yet the man of understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
will look for the more refined beauties;
the adornments of the mind.</p>

<p>12. But however you may appear
in company, and abroad, your real
character for lasting reputation and
future happiness in the world, must
be formed and established at home;
even in the kitchen, and in attending
to your domestic concerns.</p>

<p>Here is where you are to form
your character, not only for happiness,
but also for usefulness in the
world. By attending to industry,
cookery, and all the domestic employments,
you will qualify yourself
to become the mistress of a family;
and not only so, but here you will
prepare yourself to be a worthy companion
for a good and honest farmer,
a laborious mechanic, a rich merchant,
or even a minister of the gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
or any other character whatever.</p>

<p>I am willing to own, that was a
flaunting beau or a coxcomb, going
to choose a partner for an afternoon
or an evening, he would be likely to
make choice of one that was set out
in what they are pleased to call <em>complete
bon ton</em>, that would please his
fancy for just a moment to pass away
an idle hour.</p>

<p>But was a virtuous young man
about to make choice of a partner
through life; one with whom he expected
to participate, not only in the
pleasures, but also in the sorrows
and afflictions of life; one to be his
bosom companion and mistress of his
family, and to travel with him thro’
all the chequered scenes of the
thorny maze of this wilderness world;
he would be likely to choose one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
was studious in business, well acquainted
with domestic concerns, of
an unsullied character, with a soft
and easy temper of mind and one to
whom the cares of her family would
be her chief delight.</p>

<p>Such a companion as this would
ever make home agreeable. And
whether it should be their fortune to
be rich or poor, every thing would
go on harmoniously, and the domestic
affairs would be attended to
in season, and all things kept in
proper order. And finally to conclude,
we may join with the poet,
and say, that</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
